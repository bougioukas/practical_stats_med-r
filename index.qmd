# Preface {.unnumbered}

### Whom is this textbook for?

This textbook is based on my notes from a series of lectures given for a few years at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The textbook can be used as support material for practical labs on basic statistics using R at any level from beginner to advanced. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching.

I have paid particular attention to the form of the book, which I think should aid understanding the most common statistical tests using Base R and pipe-friendly functions, coherent with the 'tidyverse' design philosophy. The {ggplot2} package and many ggplot2 extensions are the preferred tools of choice for constructing data visualizations in the textbook.
