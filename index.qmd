# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

**This is a working draft.**

This is the website for the work-in-progress "Practical Statistics in Medicine with R". If you'd like a physical copy of the book or an eBook, you can wait until mid-2024 for the 1st edition; it will be published by **CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group**.

### Who this textbook is for

This introductory textbook is based on lectures and practical sessions delivered over several years at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

Designed to complement hands-on labs, the primary emphasis of this textbook is to introduce students to the basic ideas of medical statistics using R. It can also be used as a support for self-directed learning for students and researchers in biomedical field to analyze data. Additionally, bridging the gap between theory and practice, it may be useful for (under)graduate students with a science background (engineering, mathematics) who want to move towards biomedical sciences and develop essential R skills.

The textbook is organized in two primary parts: "Part 1: R basics" and "Part 2: Statistics". In **Part 1**, readers are introduced to the fundamentals of base R, along with practical methods for data manipulation using pipe-friendly functions from the `{dplyr}` package. It also provides step-by-step guidance on visualizing data using the `{ggplot2}` package and its extensions. **Part 2** covers the most common statistical tests with examples from bio-medical field. Statistical functions from Base R and the `{rstatix}` add-on package are presented side-by-side, fostering engagement and enriching reader's coding experience.
