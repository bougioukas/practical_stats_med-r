# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

**This is a working draft.**

This is the website for the work-in-progress "Practical Statistics in Medicine with R". If you'd like a physical copy of the book or an eBook, you can wait until mid-2024 for the 1st edition; it will be published by **CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group**.

### Who this textbook is for

This textbook is based on my notes from a series of lectures and practicals given for a few years at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

The textbook can be used as support material for practical labs on basic statistics in medicine using R. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching for students and researchers in biomedical field. Additionally, it may be useful for (under)graduate students with a science background (engineering, mathematics) who wants to move towards biomedical sciences.

I have paid particular attention to the form of the textbook which includes two major parts: "Part 1: R basics" and "Part 2: Statistics". **Part 1** provides an overview of base R, commonly used approaches to manipulate data with pipe-friendly functions from `{dplyr}` package, and step-by-step guidance to visualize data using the `{ggplot2}` package and its extensions. **Part 2** covers the most common statistical tests with examples from bio-medical field. Statistical functions from Base R and `{rstatix}` add-on package are presented in parallel in most examples to engage the reader and enrich the coding experience.

This textbook is intended to be self-contained and is not expected any previous experience with the R programming language. However, it assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of mathematics and introductory statistics. If you want to learn in more detail this programming language and statistics, we recommend the books below:
