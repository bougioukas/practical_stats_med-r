# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

**This is a working draft.**

This textbook is based on my notes from a series of lectures and practicals given for a few years at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

### Whom is this textbook for?

The textbook can be used as support material for practical labs on basic statistics in medicine using R. It can also be used as a support for self-teaching for students and researchers in biomedical field. Additionally, it may be useful for (under)graduate students with a science background (engineering, mathematics) who wants to move towards biomedical sciences.

I have paid particular attention to the form of the book, which I think should aid understanding the most common statistical tests using Base R and pipe-friendly functions, coherent with the *"tidyverse"* design philosophy. The `{dplyr}` package for manipulating data and the `{ggplot2}` package with many extensions for constructing data visualizations are the preferred tools of choice in this textbook, respectively. Statistical functions from Base R and the `{rstatix}` add-on package are presented in parallel in most examples of the textbook.
